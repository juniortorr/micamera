            <p class="p1 p">
              My name is Micah. I am a Norcal photographer located in the Bay
              Area where I was born and raised. I truly love living in
              California, where there are so many cool places and hidden gems
              waiting to be discovered.
            </p>
            <p class="p2 p">
              My love for photography started when I was twelve years old. The
              area I grew up in had a major impact on growing my love and
              passion for photography. There seemed to always be something
              spectacular to take a picture of. From that age on, I started
              snapping pictures everywhere I went.
            </p>
            <p class="p3 p">
              I started off as a nature and landscape photographer, but later
              found great love in portrait photography. While still in high
              school, I started taking on photographing shoots for families as a
              side hustle. After high school, I expanded to doing portrait
              shoots for senior graduates, couples, and more.
            </p>
            <p class="p4 p">
              Portrait photography has become a true passion for me over the
              years. I truly enjoy capturing the raw feelings and emotions of
              people. Nothing is better than creating memories for people
              permanently in a photograph. Let me capture memories for you to
              remember!
