          <p>Hello Friends,</p>
          <p class="p1">
            My name is Micah. I'm a Norcal photographer located in the Solano
            County area. I was born and raised near the bay area all 21 years of
            my life. I truly love living in California. There's so many cool
            places around the state and hidden gems waiting to be discovered.
          </p>
          <p class="p2">
            The area I grew up in had a major impact on growing my love and
            passion for photography. Ever since I was 12, I would make sure I
            snap pictures wherever I go, because there would always be something
            spectacular to take a picture of.
          </p>
          <p class="p3">
            I started off taking nature and landscape photos but later on my
            love for taking portraits really expanded. In highschool I started
            doing more family shoots and found that I had a love for it.
          </p>
          <p class="p4">
            Taking portraits for people has been a true passion because when
            taking these photos I'm able to capture that person's excitement and
            even love. Nothing is better than creating memories for people
            permanently in a photograph. Let me capture memories for you to
            remember!
          </p>
